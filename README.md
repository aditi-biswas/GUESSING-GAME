# GUESSING-GAME
Guess the number I'm thinking

This is a python guessing game. I am thinking of a random number from 1 to 100. Let's see if you can guess the number correctly. Try it out..this is really fun!
If your guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD.
If your guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're WARM.
If your guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER.
If your guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting WARMER.
Let's get started...
